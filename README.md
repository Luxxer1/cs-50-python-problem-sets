# CS50 Python Problem Sets Repository

This repository contains my solutions to the problem sets from the CS50 Introduction to Computer Science course, specifically the Python track. The course is offered by Harvard University and covers fundamental concepts in computer science and programming.

## Problem Sets

### Week 1
1. **Deep Thought:**
   - Description: Determine if the user's input holds the answer to the Great Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything. Output "Yes" for input 42, "Forty Two," or "forty-two," and "No" otherwise. 
   - Directory: `deep`
   - File: `deep.py`

2. **Home Federal Savings Bank:**
   - Description: Determine the reward based on the user's greeting at the Home Federal Savings Bank. Output $0 for "hello," $20 for a greeting starting with "h," and $100 otherwise.
   - Directory: `bank`
   - File: `bank.py`

3. **File Extensions:**
   - Description: Identify the media type of a file based on its name's suffix. Output the corresponding media type for common file extensions or application/octet-stream to default.
   - Directory: `extensions`
   - File: `extensions.py`

4. **Math Interpreter:**
   - Description: Perform basic arithmetic operations on integer inputs, supporting addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Display the result formatted to one decimal place.
   - Directory: `interpreter`
   - File: `interpreter.py`

5. **Meal Time:**
   - Description: Detect whether it's time for breakfast, lunch, or dinner based on user-inputted time in 24-hour format.
   - Directory: `meal`
   - File: `meal.py`



## How to Use
- Each problem set is contained in its respective file.
- To run a specific problem set, execute the corresponding Python file using a Python interpreter.

Feel free to explore the solutions and use them as a reference. If you have any questions or suggestions, feel free to open an issue or reach out to me.
